# PRECISION LIVER TUMOUR SEGMENTATION IN CT-SCANS  WITH A MODIFIED  SEGNET ARCHITECTURE 

Liver tumor segmentation in CT scans using a modified SegNet architecture aims to significantly enhance segmentation accuracy. By addressing the limitations of existing methods and introducing tailored modifications to the SegNet model, the project seeks to provide a reliable and efficient tool for clinical use. The successful implementation of this system has the potential to improve diagnostic precision and treatment planning for liver cancer
patients, ultimately contributing to better clinical outcomes. Precision liver tumor segmentation using SegNet involves meticulous data preparation, appropriate model architecture selection, rigorous training, and careful evaluation. By following these steps and considerations, you can effectively leverage SegNet for accurate segmentation in CT scans, aiding in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning...!
